","Revitalift Derm Intensives 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum is our most potent hydrating formula with our highest concentration of pure hyaluronic acid. So effective, it immediately hydrates, plumps skin in 1 week, and reduces wrinkles.

What Does Hyaluronic Acid Serum Do?

Hyaluronic Acid Serum is an anti-aging face serum for visibly bouncy and more youthful-looking skin. This lightweight hydrating serum absorbs quickly with no tacky feel or leftover residue and replenishes hydration with the following results:
 

Immediately, it delivers intense moisture that leaves the skin with a fully hydrated and dewy glow.
In 1 week, skin is visibly plumped and feels firmer and more elastic. The youthful, bouncy feel returns and skin is visibly refreshed and glowing with moisture. 
Overtime, fine lines and wrinkles are visibly reduced.

What Makes Our Hyaluronic Acid Formula Special?
Our potent formula combines high and low-molecular weight pure hyaluronic acid for a dual replumping and hydrating effect. Here’s how it works:

0.5% high molecular weight pure hyaluronic acid intensely re-hydrates the skin’s surface and stays on top of the skin to help lock in moisture for dewy-looking skin.
1% low molecular weight pure hyaluronic acid absorbs more easily to help smooth skin texture and instantly plump skin.

Complexion is brighter, luminous, and glowing
Overtime, wrinkles are visibly reduced, even forehead wrinkles


What Is Pure Retinol?
While there are many retinols available in the market — complexes, derivatives and pure — dermatologists recommend pure retinol because it is the most researched and effective anti-aging ingredient. Pure Retinol is an optimal concentration that has been dermatologist-validated for fast, visible results.

Though most effective, it is unstable when exposed to air and light, causing it to be less effective overtime. L’Oreal Paris’s exclusive technology, Retinol Guard™, helps to protect the formula so it is potent and effective from the first drop to the last.

*Results based on a 12-week clinical study of women aged 35-75 when used as directed.
*An external panel of dermatologists validated that Revitalift Derm Intensives serums uphold strict formulation standards and reviewed independent clinical testing results and protocols.

SKIN-PLUMPING COLLAGEN: Collagen is a naturally occurring protein in the skin. As we age, collagen and moisture levels diminish. Skin loses its balance and wrinkles are formed. Our collagen delivers intense hydration to the skin and helps to visibly smooth wrinkles over time.

PROVEN RESULTS: Overnight, rich moisture instantly restores skin’s cushion and bounce. In 1 week of use, skin feels smoother and plumper. In just 4 weeks, wrinkles appear more filled in.*

FAST ABSORPTION, NON-GREASY: L'Oréal Paris Collagen Moisture Filler Fragrance-Free Cream is essential for achieving younger-looking skin. It delivers hydration to all skin types, including sensitive skin, and absorbs quickly without leaving a greasy film.

GOOD FOR DAY AND NIGHT: Use Collagen Moisture Filler Cream in the AM on clean skin or after serum. It creates the perfect moisturized base before applying makeup. Use in the PM for deep hydration overnight.

Restores skin's natural fullness for a more youthful look.
See improvement on cheekbones, under-eye and wrinkles.

Dermatologists’ latest approach to anti-aging is not just about chasing after lines and wrinkles, it's about replenishing skin's volume. Skin loses volume when levels of Hyaluronic Acid—a naturally occurring, hydrating substance within the skin—starts to decline. As volume is gradually lost, the effects of gravity become more apparent—skin loses fullness.
